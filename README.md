# My-SH

A shell-based working environment framework in which you can switch shell and domain however you want. It also contains some handy configurations of useful tools such as `vim` and `tmux`.

## Usage

1. Choose your preferable shell to use - so far only `zsh` and `bash` are supported.
2. Install the enhancement for shell - `oh-my-zsh` for `zsh` and `bash-it` for `bash`.
3. Choose your domain - it could be `goron`, `zora`, etc.
4. Install `my-sh` by running:

    ```install.sh <shell> <domain>```
